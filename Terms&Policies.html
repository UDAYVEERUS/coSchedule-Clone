        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.</p>
        <p>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of the Internet and online communications, however, we cannot guarantee that any information transmitted online will remain confidential. We are not liable for the illegal acts of third parties such as criminal hackers.</p>
        <h3 class="termsHeading">Do We Use Cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes (Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information).</p>
        <p>We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

        <p>We may share personal information with trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. For example, we may hire a vendor to help us send and manage e-mail.</p>
        <p>CoSchedule may share personal information with a successor if all or part of our business is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction, or in the event of a corporate reorganization. We will maintain data integrity and security through technical and business due diligence and as required by U.S. and EU GDPR regulations.</p>
        <p>We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.</p>
        <p>However, because non-personal information does not identify who you are, we do not limit the ways we may use or share non-personal information. Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
